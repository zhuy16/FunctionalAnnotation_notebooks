# clusterProfiler

This repo is for functional annotation and visualization of gene sets. These include Gene Ontology, KEGG, Wikipath, Disease Ontology, GSEA etc. 
Originally these codes are from a R book written by Guangchuang Yu from Hongkang. https://github.com/YuLab-SMU/clusterProfiler. For my own convinience I converted it to jupyter notebooks for easy reporting and for tracking progress.
The 0_setup.R, inculded all the packages to be installed to run these notebook.
