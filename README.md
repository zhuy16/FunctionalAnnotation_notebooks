#### This repo is for functional annotation and visualization of gene sets.

"Functional annotation" implies finding the biological meaning of the gene set you obtained from your analysis.

These include **Gene Ontology, KEGG, Wikipath, Disease Ontology, GSEA etc.** 

Originally these codes are from a R book written by Guangchuang Yu from Hongkang.

For my own convinience I converted it to jupyter notebooks for easy reporting and for tracking progress.

**The 0_setup.R, inculdes all the packages to be installed to run these notebook.** 
The notebook folder contains all the essential notebooks, and the R folder contains all the codes copied from the original R book. 
The original Repo is https://github.com/YuLab-SMU/clusterProfiler.
